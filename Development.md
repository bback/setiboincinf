# Development Plans #

I reactivated the source (in use by many people) and created a Google Code project for it.

My next plans are to replace the current hsqldb storage by a [perst](http://www.mcobject.com/perst/) storage system implementation.

The next release will require at least [Java](http://java.sun.com) 1.5!
