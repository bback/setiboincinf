#summary SetiBoincInf Overview

= Introduction =

SetiBoincInf is a FREE add-on especially for a BOINC project called SETI@HOME. It retrieves the credit information for an account and stores the credits together with the client information for each client host.

Updating can be done using a console program which retrieves an update all X minutes. The main program is a GUI to view the stored entries, update, import and export them, see some overall statistics and to maintain the entries.

The program is written in JAVA and uses the Eclipse SWT GUI library. It runs on Windows and Linux (GTK). 


= Development Plans =

I reactivated the source (in use by many people) and created a GoogleCode project for it.

My next plans are to replace the current hsqldb storage by a (much faster) perst storage system implementation.
