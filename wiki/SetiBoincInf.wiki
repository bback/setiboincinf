= Introduction =

SetiBoincInf is an add-on for a [http://http://boinc.berkeley.edu/ BOINC] project called [http://setiathome.berkeley.edu SETI@HOME]. The program retrieves the credit information for an account and stores the credits together with the client information for each client host.

I use the program to keep track of my current credit average and if any of my client computers that run [http://setiathome.berkeley.edu SETI@HOME] stopped working. And I have a history of my overall credits and the credits of the client computers.

You can use a console program to retrieve the current data periodically. The main program is a GUI to view the stored data, and to update, delete, import and export them.

SetiBoincInf is written in JAVA and uses the Eclipse SWT GUI library (included in download). It runs on Windows and Linux (GTK).
